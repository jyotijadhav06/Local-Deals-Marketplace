# **Local Deals Marketplace on Aptos**

## **Description**

The **Local Deals Marketplace** is a decentralized platform built on the **Aptos blockchain** that enables local businesses to create and sell special deals directly to customers using **AptosCoin (APT)**.

* **Business owners** can list deals with a price and description.
* **Customers** can purchase deals by transferring APT directly to the business owner.
* The contract tracks the total number of purchases and automatically deactivates a deal when a set limit (100 purchases) is reached.

## **Vision**

Our vision is to create a **community-driven marketplace** where:

* Small and local businesses can **digitally showcase** offers without relying on centralized platforms.
* Customers enjoy **secure and transparent** transactions powered by blockchain.
* Local economies are strengthened through **direct merchant-to-customer** interactions.

## **Future Scope**

Planned enhancements include:

1. **Multiple deal listings per business** (instead of one active deal per account).
2. **Deal expiration dates** based on time, not just purchase count.
3. **Discount codes or referral rewards** for loyal customers.
4. **Integration with geolocation** to filter deals by city or neighborhood.
5. **Business reviews and ratings** stored on-chain.
6. **NFT-based vouchers** for transferable deals.
